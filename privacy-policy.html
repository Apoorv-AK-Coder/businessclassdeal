                <p>Access and Correction: You can review, update, or correct inaccuracies in your personal information by logging into your account and editing your profile settings or contacting us at the email address provided below.</p>
                <p>Deletion: You may request the deletion of your account and associated personal data. We will comply unless we need to retain certain information for legal or legitimate business purposes (e.g., tax or regulatory requirements, dispute resolution).</p>

                <p>Restrict or Object to Processing: You can ask us to restrict or object to certain types of processing (e.g., direct marketing). We will comply unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds or the processing is needed for legal reasons.</p>
                <p>Withdraw Consent: Where we rely on your consent for processing (e.g., email marketing), you can withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in marketing emails or contacting us directly. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal.</p>
                <p>Do Not Track Signals: Some browsers allow you to enable “Do Not Track” (DNT). Our Website does not currently respond to DNT signals, but we encourage you to review this policy and exercise your rights as described.</p>

                <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
                <p>Encryption: We use industry-standard encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) to secure data transmitted between your device and our servers.</p>
                <p>Access Controls: We restrict access to personal information to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop, or improve the Website.</p>

                <p>Monitoring and Auditing: We regularly review our security policies and procedures, and we conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.</p>
                <p>Despite these efforts, no security system is perfect or impenetrable. We cannot guarantee absolute security. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account, please notify us immediately.</p>
